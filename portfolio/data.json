From building efficient APIs and optimizing performance-critical code to crafting clean, intuitive user interfaces, I focus on creating software that is scalable, maintainable, and built to last.\n\n<b>System design?</b> Been there, built that—and iterated on it. I enjoy breaking down large, ambiguous problems into well-structured components and making thoughtful trade-offs across scalability, reliability, and simplicity.\n\nRecently, my [machine learning research paper](https://www.ijfmr.com/research-paper.php?id=64396) was published in the International Journal for Multidisciplinary Research (IJFMR).",
